# Object-Tracking-and-Detectiion-using-opencv-and-python
Here, I focus on two main steps: on the first one we will do Object detection and on the second one Object tracking.


Object detection is simply about identifying and locating all known objects in a scene. Object tracking is about locking onto a particular moving object(s) in real-time. The two are similar, however. Objects can be tracked based solely on motion features without knowing the actual objects being tracked.

Object tracking is the process of: Taking an initial set of object detections (such as an input set of bounding box coordinates) Creating a unique ID for each of the initial detections. And then tracking each of the objects as they move around frames in a video, maintaining the assignment of unique IDs.


Uses:--
It is widely used in computer vision tasks such as image annotation, activity recognition, face detection, face recognition, video object co-segmentation. It is also used in tracking objects, for example tracking a ball during a football match, tracking movement of a cricket bat, or tracking a person in a video.

Image processing is a method of extracting some useful information by converting image into digital inform by performing some operations on it. Object detection and tracking are the task that is important and challenging such as video surveillance and vehicle navigation.
